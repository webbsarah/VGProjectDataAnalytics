Video Games Project for Data Analytics 
SDEV101 Final Project

At first, we found and analysed a .csv file from CORGIS, Then cleaned, condesnsed, and analysed the dataset. 
Then, we added our findings into a powerpoint slideshow. 
In the presentation, my team and I introduced the audience to the data analytics process when applied to a dataset focused on video games from 2004-2008. Covering data collection, cleaning, visualization, and interpretation, we utilized various formatting techniques to extract insights from the video game data. These insights were then translated into visual formatting to answer and analyze certain takeaways we got from questions we asked from viewing the data. The presentation concluded with an overview of what that data says about the video game industry.
